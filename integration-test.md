  - [ ] Click dropdown - shows tasks from TaskFlow
  - [ ] All 3 test tasks are visible with correct titles
  - [ ] Task descriptions appear when hovering/selecting

### Task Selection & Timer
- [ ] **Select first task**: "Review project documentation"
  - [ ] Success toast: "ðŸŽ¯ Task selected!" appears
  - [ ] Selected task confirmation shows below dropdown
  - [ ] Timer display shows task name
- [ ] **Test timer functionality**:
  - [ ] Click "Start Focus Session"
  - [ ] Timer counts down from 25:00
  - [ ] Progress ring fills as time progresses
  - [ ] Can pause and resume timer
  - [ ] Can reset timer
  - [ ] Can skip to break (shows orange theme)

### Task Completion Flow
- [ ] **Complete focus session** (or wait for it to finish):
  - [ ] Toast notification: "ðŸŽ¯ Focus session complete!" appears
  - [ ] Task completion modal appears
  - [ ] Modal shows correct task name and time spent
  - [ ] Two options: "Mark as Complete" and "Keep Working"

- [ ] **Test task completion**:
  - [ ] Click "Mark as Complete"
  - [ ] Loading state appears on button
  - [ ] Success animation and message: "Task Completed!"
  - [ ] Success toast: "âœ… Task completed!" appears
  - [ ] Modal closes automatically after 2 seconds
  - [ ] New focus session starts

## Phase 4: Cross-Application Verification

### Verify Task Status in TaskFlow
- [ ] **Switch to TaskFlow dashboard**:
  - [ ] Refresh the page
  - [ ] "Review project documentation" task shows as completed
  - [ ] Completion timestamp is recent
  - [ ] Other tasks remain incomplete

### Test Multiple Task Workflow
- [ ] **Return to FocusTime**:
  - [ ] Select second task: "Fix authentication bug"
  - [ ] Start another focus session
  - [ ] Complete the session and mark task complete
- [ ] **Verify in TaskFlow**:
  - [ ] Second task is now marked complete
  - [ ] First task remains complete
  - [ ] Third task remains incomplete

### Test Edge Cases
- [ ] **Test "No specific task" option**:
  - [ ] Select "No specific task" from dropdown
  - [ ] Start and complete focus session
  - [ ] Verify modal shows "free focus session" message
  - [ ] No task completion option is offered

- [ ] **Test "Keep Working" option**:
  - [ ] Select third task and complete focus session
  - [ ] Click "Keep Working" instead of "Mark as Complete"
  - [ ] Verify new focus session starts with same task
  - [ ] Verify task remains incomplete in TaskFlow

## Phase 5: Authentication & Security

### Token Management
- [ ] **Test session persistence**:
  - [ ] Refresh FocusTime page - remains logged in
  - [ ] Close and reopen browser tab - remains logged in
  - [ ] Check browser DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Session Storage
  - [ ] Verify tokens are stored in sessionStorage (not localStorage)

### Logout Flow
- [ ] **Test logout from FocusTime**:
  - [ ] Click user avatar/name in header
  - [ ] Click "Sign out" button
  - [ ] Redirects to landing page
  - [ ] Header shows "Not signed in"
  - [ ] Session storage is cleared
  - [ ] Cannot access timer page without re-authentication

### Security Verification
- [ ] **Check OAuth parameters** (DevTools â†’ Network):
  - [ ] Authorization request includes PKCE `code_challenge`
  - [ ] State parameter is present for CSRF protection
  - [ ] Token exchange includes `code_verifier`
- [ ] **Verify API authentication**:
  - [ ] API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  - [ ] Invalid tokens return 401 responses
  - [ ] Proper CORS headers are present

## Phase 6: Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Network Error Handling
- [ ] **Test offline behavior**:
  - [ ] Disconnect internet during OAuth flow
  - [ ] Verify appropriate error messages appear
  - [ ] Reconnect - can retry successfully

### Invalid State Handling
- [ ] **Test direct callback access**:
  - [ ] Navigate directly to `/auth/callback` without OAuth flow
  - [ ] Verify error handling and user feedback
- [ ] **Test expired tokens**:
  - [ ] Wait for token expiry (or manually expire in code)
  - [ ] Verify automatic logout and re-authentication prompt

### TaskFlow API Errors
- [ ] **Test TaskFlow unavailable**:
  - [ ] Stop TaskFlow server
  - [ ] Try to use FocusTime
  - [ ] Verify appropriate error messages and recovery options

## Phase 7: Mobile & Responsive Testing

### Mobile Browser Testing
- [ ] **Test on mobile device or DevTools mobile view**:
  - [ ] OAuth flow works on mobile browsers
  - [ ] Touch-friendly button sizes
  - [ ] Timer display is readable on small screens
  - [ ] Task selection dropdown works on mobile
  - [ ] Toast notifications display correctly

### Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] **Test in different browsers**:
  - [ ] Chrome/Chromium
  - [ ] Firefox
  - [ ] Safari (if available)
  - [ ] Edge (if available)

## Final Verification Checklist
